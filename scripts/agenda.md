# Meeting Agenda

## 2023.7.4

---

* Two approaches to the segmentation problem.
    * Bottom up
    * Machine Learning Model
* Pros and Cons, and biggest needs for them (***need detailed explanation on latex report***)
* **For the bottom up approach, one major problemt ot be solved is a set-class realizer, might need to work on that.**
* **For the machine learning approach, we need to define what the task is.**
* Need more details on segmentation, does it mean it is a majortask in the land of both tonal and atonal?
* About the "*strcuture*" mentioned in Hasty, are there some papers exploring the general underlying struture?

### Need

1. how to represent the segmentation mark in midi sequence?
2. find a sketch of schematic for grouping/segmentation method for the bottom up approach
3. define the task for the machine learning approach.
