# Layout of segmentation requirements

## **Domains**

- Dynamic: `note.notRest.volume.getDynamicContext()`
- Set Class: Maybe I need a set class realizer. What are its funtionalities?
- Timbre: `note.articulation.name`
- Intervalic Association: Also need a registeral interval realizer. What do we need?
- Countour: controur realizer, is it the definition I thoght?
- Instrumental arrangement: `note.instrument.name`
