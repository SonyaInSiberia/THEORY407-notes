# Topic of Interest

Gneral topics.

1. Relation wise embedding of music.
    * Relation pair representation.
    * Which space?
    * **The algorithm**.
    * Embedding what **MEANING**, tonal/atonal?
2. Representing tonal strcutre in atonal system.
    * Relationwise?
    * Tonal operation?
    * In which system?
3. Key finder
    * Too big too hard.
    * Maybe can be used to test the representation?

Some Questions on this research.

* What do we mean by meaning? A way to explain tonal music?
* How this data representation can be used?
* Practical problem: might just make it into machine learning algos to see how machine compose.
  * Better representation of ML in Music.
* Need to focus on a specific genre?
* Want to discover a good, whole new representation of music so that it in its own can yield a better performance in musical generation. Be honest: This is for a Deep Learning model representation.
* **BUT** At the same time it helps us a new way of thinking music and its meaning abstraction.
* Primary source for research such as this kind? Maybe specific analysis on a specific piece, what should be evaluated? How Tonic and Dominant are related?
